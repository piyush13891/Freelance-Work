There are many test approaches but I try to use one of the below for regular QA work. However If there is specific requirement then I can work on that as well.

1. Dynamic and heuristic approaches - Self discovering and learning
2. Standard-compliant approach specified by industry-specific standards - Using existing Testing standards
3. Methodical approach, which is based on failures - Based on previous experience of the system

Improving QA- 
- Start with getting basic product understanding and derive a test strategy and plan
- Create Test plan(If required)
- Create Test cases sheet with steps and details(If Required)
- Test the Application/product under test
- Capture the issues and Bugs with Detailed test report.
- Prepare Test and Defect summary report
- When developers fix the bugs, retest bugs and regression testing(if requested)

The above process and approach might need changes based on specific project needs, risk factors of Application under test, etc
