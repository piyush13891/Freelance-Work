Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to express my interest in these testing requirements. I have more than 8 years of experience on Manual testing, Mobile and Website Testing, Regression, Functional, UAT, API Testing, POSTMAN and Automation testing of UI. I am an ISTQB certified tester and have demonstrated Testing and Automation capabilities working on high risk and complex applications. Testing with a result oriented approach by reducing defects and improving product quality using best and proven testing practices.

I believe in 100% client satisfaction, 100% feature testing coverage and I am confident you will find my work superior for the job. I will deliver and handle the requirements with utmost care and precision.

As I am not working on any parallel assignment now, I will be able to spend dedicated time for this task. Also I am trying to build a portfolio on Upwork(already working on other platforms as QA) hence offering pricing relaxations.

Please have a look at attached artefacts that I have already delivered for my other client. Looking forward to connecting with you and working together.
